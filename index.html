                <p>Hi, I'm Adam, an amateur portrait artist with a passion for capturing the character, emotion and integrity of a subject.</p>
                <p>During the day, I work as a legal librarian at a top US law firm in London, at night I paint portraits.</p>
                <p>Portrait painting has always been a hobby of mine. Most of my work to date has involved painting family members and friends - now I would like to branch out and offer a low rate commission service to the wider public. I don't have the luxury of an artistic studio, so all of my creations are produced within a dedicated space on my kitchen table.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Artistic Medium</h2>
            <div class="textwrap2">
                <img src="images/paint-pastel.jpg" width="300" height="400" class="textwrap2"/>
                <p>As an amateur artist, I have experimented using a range of artistic mediums, namely acrylic, oil and watercolour painting, as well as oil pastel and charcoal.</p>
                <p>Acrylic paints and oil pastels are my preferred mediums, so my work focuses on using these. The latter medium helps to enhance tones and the notable features of the subject.</p><br>
                <p>For examples see my <a href="portfolio.html">PORTFOLIO</a></p>
            </div>
            <h2>Subjects</h2>
            <p>Humans any age group, gender or ethnicity, along with animals both domestic and wild.</p>
            <p>All I need to complete your commission is a good quality colour photograph of the subject (A4 size - face to shoulder only). This can be sent to me electronically via email. &nbsp<a href="mailto:adam_wackett@live.com?subject=Painting commission enquiry">CONTACT ME</a></p><br>
            <p>The photographs below demonstrate what would be suitable.</p>
